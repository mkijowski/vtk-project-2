### Code folder
This folder contains several different attempts at rendering the image data.

The most promising right now is `actor.py` since it briefly opens a render
window.  The rest currently seg-fault.

* `actor.py` implements Dr. Wishcgoll's sample Mat2Vtk pipeline.
* `video.py` implements a hybrid pipeline
* `polydata.py` implements a poly-data pipeline
* `interactive.py` was used to test the output format for my image data,
  although that does not mean the data is in the correct format...
