### Background subtraction
Two working examples of background subtraction.  The only two algorithms that
were installed with opencv by default appear to be MOG and KNN.  

Bot hof these algorthims have a lot of noise in the foreground mask.  Initial
attempts will be to get a different, more modern algorithm working (such as CNT)
followed by denoising and applying other pre-processing algorithms.
