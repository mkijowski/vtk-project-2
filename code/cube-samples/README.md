### Cube Samples
This folder contains a set of cube samples taken from the internet to provide 
examples of rendering volume data from a given array.  I hope to better 
understand both `vtkImageImport` and the underlying array structure so that
I can adapt my own code to render a video volume.

Cube samples were taken from the following:

* https://vtk.org/Wiki/VTK/Examples/Python/vtkWithNumpy
* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39976669/vtk-how-to-import-3d-image-data-via-imageimport-on-c-for-volume-rendering

With some changes to adapt them to current VTK.
